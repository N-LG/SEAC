^Steps to do a manual installation of Seac

  1) first you need to determine the name of the disk on which the computer boots, you can find this information in the bios
  2) start Seac via a usb key, a cdrom, a floppy disk, or pxe
  3) open the "partd" application
  4) select the disk found in step 1
  5) create a partition of type 30h and size 1MB
  6) create and format (if it does not already exist) a fat partition (type code 0Bh)
  7) restart Seac to have the partition numbers numbered during the boot phase
  8) create a system folder (you can name it whatever) in the fat partition
  9) copy the entire #dm directory into the newly created system directory
 10) copy the startup script "cfg.sh" into "boot.sh"
 11) open the cfg.sh startup script
 12) we delete the entire file and replace with the lines:
    "cd [system folder address]"
    "fds"
    "ex boot.sh -v"
 13) compile the startup script using the command "FASM ETAGE4.ASM ETAGE4.BIN"
 14) compile the bootable image using the command "FASM ETAGE2_MBR.ASM SEAC.BIN"
 15) open the "partd" application and select the disk found in step 1
 16) load the "SEAC.BIN" boot image into the 30h type partition
 17) change the boot program to "BIOS.MBR"

%the system is ready!
%you can now customize the boot phase by editing the "boot.sh" file
